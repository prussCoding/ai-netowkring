Explanation:

1. In the traditional networking configuration, we define a simple Router class in Python, add interfaces to it, and display the router's interfaces with their IP addresses.
2. In the advanced AI-driven network configuration, we use Mininet to create a custom SDN topology. We create two switches (s1 and s2) and two hosts (h1 and h2) and establish links between them.
3. SDN controllers (e.g., OpenFlow) would typically be used to manage and configure the network dynamically. In this example, we focus on creating the topology to illustrate the concept.
4. When you run the advanced SDN configuration, it creates a virtual network with hosts and switches and allows them to communicate. This is a basic example of how SDN can be used for network configuration and management.
