Explanation:

1. We import the necessary libraries, including NumPy for data manipulation, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib for data visualization.
2. We create sample data with three columns: time of day, day of week, and network traffic volume. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this with actual network traffic data.
3. We split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y), where X contains the time of day and day of week, and y contains the network traffic.
4. We create a LinearRegression model and fit it to the data using the fit method.
5. We use the trained model to predict network traffic for a specific time and day (e.g., 2 PM on a Wednesday) using the predict method.
6. Finally, we plot the actual data points and the regression line to visualize the network traffic prediction.
