Explanation:

1. We simulate network traffic data using random values for demonstration purposes. In a real scenario, you would replace this with actual network traffic data.
2. We create an isolation forest model from scikit-learn, which is used for anomaly detection. The contamination parameter is set to 5% to define the threshold for detecting anomalies.
3. The script enters a continuous loop where it:
    - Simulates real-time network traffic data (replace this with actual data).
    - Predicts if the new data point is anomalous using the isolation forest model.
    - If the prediction indicates an anomaly, it prints a message and can implement a response mechanism (e.g., block the suspicious IP, alert an administrator). In this example, we print a message but do not perform an actual response.
4. The script sleeps for a short period before making the next observation. In practice, network traffic would be continuously monitored.
