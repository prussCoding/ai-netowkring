# Load the model for inference
loaded_model = load_model("network_model.h5")

# Perform real-time inference on incoming network data
prediction = loaded_model.predict(new_data)

# Challenge: Network environments require low-latency, real-time inference, 
# which can be challenging for resource-intensive models.
