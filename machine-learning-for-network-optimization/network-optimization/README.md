Explanation:

1. We import the PuLP library to create a linear programming problem.
2. We define variables (app1_bw, app2_bw, app3_bw) representing the bandwidth allocation for each application. These variables are continuous and bounded by zero or greater.
3. We set the objective function to maximize the total bandwidth utilization, which is the sum of bandwidth allocated to each application.
4. We define constraints that limit the bandwidth allocation for each application based on specified limits.
5. We solve the linear programming problem using the solve method.
6. We print the optimization status and the optimized bandwidth allocation for each application.

In this example, the script optimizes the allocation of bandwidth to three different network applications while respecting their bandwidth limits. You can modify the constraints and parameters to represent a more complex network optimization scenario with multiple applications and constraints.
