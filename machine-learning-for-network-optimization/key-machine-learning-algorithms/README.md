Linear Regression Fundamentals:
Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. In simple linear regression, there is one feature, and the equation is:

y == mx + b

where:

- y is the target variable (e.g., network latency).
- x is the feature variable (e.g., time of day).
- m is the slope of the regression line.
- b is the intercept.

Application in Network Optimization:
In a network optimization context, linear regression can be used to predict network latency based on various features, such as the time of day, the number of active users, or the network load. By predicting latency, network administrators can make proactive decisions to optimize network performance.

Python Script - Predicting Network Latency with Linear Regression:
Here's a Python script that demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict network latency based on the time of day. We'll use the scikit-learn library for machine learning.

Explanation:

1. We create a dataset with simulated network latency data for different times of the day.
2. We create a linear regression model using scikit-learn and train it with the time_of_day as the feature and latency as the target variable.
3. We predict network latency for a specific time (predicted_time) using the trained model.
4. We visualize the data, the regression line, and the predicted latency using matplotlib.
5. Finally, we print the predicted latency for the specified time.

In this example, linear regression helps predict network latency based on the time of day, allowing network administrators to anticipate and optimize network performance during peak hours.
