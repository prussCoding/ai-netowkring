Step 1: Data Preprocessing
First, we need to preprocess the network traffic data. For this example, we'll use synthetic data.

Step 2: Model Definition
Next, we define a simple neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API.

Step 3: Model Training
Now, we train the model using the preprocessed data.

Step 4: Model Deployment
To deploy the trained model for real-time decision-making, we can wrap it in a Python function.

You can now use the predict_latency function to make real-time predictions based on network traffic features.

This example demonstrates the entire workflow of training a machine learning model for network optimization using TensorFlow. The trained model can be deployed and used to make predictions in real-time, allowing network administrators to optimize network resources based on predicted network latency.
