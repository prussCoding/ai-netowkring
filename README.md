Section 1: What is AI in Networking?

Code example: Start with a simple Python script that demonstrates a basic AI concept like linear regression. Explain how this can be applied to network optimization.
Section 2: Traditional Networking vs. AI-Driven Networking

Code example: Show a side-by-side comparison of a traditional networking configuration (e.g., setting up a basic router) and a more advanced AI-driven network configuration (e.g., using software-defined networking).
Section 3: Key Benefits of AI in Networking

Code example: Develop a Python script that uses machine learning to predict network traffic patterns and optimize network resources dynamically.
Section 4: AI-Enabled Use Cases in Networking

Code example 1: Build a network security application using machine learning to detect and respond to suspicious network activity.
Code example 2: Create a simple routing algorithm in Python that demonstrates how AI can make intelligent routing decisions.
Section 5: Challenges and Considerations

Code example: Discuss the challenges of training and deploying AI models in a network environment. You can show code snippets related to model training and deployment, highlighting potential complexities.
Section 6: Current Trends and Future Outlook

Code example: Explore emerging networking technologies like software-defined networking (SDN) and show code snippets or configurations related to SDN implementation.
Section 7: Resources and Next Steps

Code example: Provide links to online courses or tutorials where viewers can learn more about coding for AI in networking. Mention specific coding languages (Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch) that are relevant.
